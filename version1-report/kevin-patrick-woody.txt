Thanks for producing a single pdf report for me to read.  That really
made grading easier!


Testing Report ( 13 / 15)
--------------

-2: It's not clear from the report what the tests actually were.  The
 names of the testing methods aren't really enough.

Design Documentation ( 15 / 20)
-------------------------------

It's not clear what the arrows mean in the diagrams (I think the
arrows might be on the wrong ends of the segments). 

Design ( 25 / 30)
-----------------

Not clear how you'd add more file formats.  It's good to have the
FileHandlerInterface, but seems like you'd need an if chain to choose
which implementing class to use.
